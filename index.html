<p>I've started something like this several times, but this time I hope I am going to make it bigger and better.
This little 'DOS' is suppose to be a little clone of MS-Dos. My first "Operating System" was <a href="http://jeytas.github.io/JeytasOS/">JeytasOS</a> and I discontinued working on it after a while.
This was my first big project after over half a year. This will also be a project you'll be able to find on my <a href="http://jeytasgame.de.vc">JeytasGame</a> website, after it moved to my new <a href="http://jeytas.ddns.net">jeytas.ddns.net</a> server.</p>

<a id="jeidos-itself" class="anchor" href="#jeidos-itself" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jeidos itself</h2>

<p>Jeidos is the name of this little <em>operating system</em>. You can download it (.exe files will be available later) and start it. Just follow the instruction that says <code>[...] Start by typing in 'help'</code> and you will be able to get an interactive help menu.
If you do not want the system to remind you of the help, open the file help.txt and follow the included instructions
There are already quite a few features, including a little <em>user management</em> that you can try out for yourself. </p>

<h3>
<a id="how-to-start-the-os" class="anchor" href="#how-to-start-the-os" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to start the OS</h3>

<p>Starting the OS is actually fairy simple. If you're on Linux, just start the "start.rb" file in your Terminal, and if you are on Windows just open the Jeidos.exe file. Then you will be asked to create an account or login. </p>

<h3>
<a id="user-management-system" class="anchor" href="#user-management-system" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User management system</h3>

<p>The <em>user management system</em> is currently still in development, but the biggest part of it is complete. Using it is very simple. Just start the <em>start.rb</em> file and it will ask:</p>

<p><code>1.) Create username</code></p>

<p><code>2.) Login</code></p>

<p>When you type in <em>1</em> (and press enter), the system will ask you for your desired username. Please only use ASCII symbols. Then you press enter and the system shuts down. Now you have a folder called <em>user</em> and in that folder there is a file called <em>your_username.user</em>. That is your userfile that currently just includes one line of text. I am working on different features that use more than just one line. Now, open <em>start.rb</em> once again and this time, type in <em>2</em> (and press enter) and you will be able to login. enter your username and your password and you're good to go! The system will now start!</p>

<h3>
<a id="where-is-the-password" class="anchor" href="#where-is-the-password" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where is the password?</h3>

<p>Your password is saved under <code>your_username.user</code>. That can be opened with a normal text editor. The password in that file was create with my random password generator. If you wish to change it, just replace the password with your desired password.</p>

<p><strong>Caution:</strong>
It is important that the file only includes <strong>one line</strong>. Any more than one line and the system won't be able to properly detect your password</p>
