<a id="about-the-programme-and-me" class="anchor" href="#about-the-programme-and-me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the programme and me</h2>

<p>I've started something like this several times, but this time I hope I am going to make it bigger and better.
This little 'DOS' is suppose to be a little clone of MS-Dos. My first "Operating System" was <a href="http://jeytas.github.io/JeytasOS/">JeytasOS</a> and I discontinued working on it after a while.
After making a few programmes that use graphics, I stopped programming for a while and started learning real languages. 
Then my school work experience began and I did it in an IT-Department of a 'company' in my town. Directly in the first week I started programming again.
I was bored sometimes (I didn't have tasks all the time), so I went to <a href="http://koding.com">Koding</a> with my Laptop whilst on work and there I started programming the programme you are looking at right now.
This was my first big project after over half a year. This will also be a project you'll be able to find on my <a href="http://jeytasgame.de.vc">JeytasGame</a> website, after it moved to my new <a href="http://jeytas.ddns.net">jeytas.ddns.net</a> server.</p>

<p><strong>About me</strong></p>

<p>If you don't know me that well, I can tell you a little about myself. I am a German (part Swedish) programmer who's currently living in a small town in the region of Westphalia. I <em>worked</em> in the IKT (Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie / Information and communications techonolgy) of the Wittekindshof in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Oeynhausen">Bad Oeynhausen</a>. I worked there for three weeks and got a lot of new knowledge about IT itself. I've visited every part of the IKT, including the server room. This let to the idea of making my own server with my Raspberry Pi (and so I did <a href="http://jeytas.ddns.net">Server</a>). I also learnt the programming language used there, called FOP (at least its basics). But besides that, my programming skills are all self-taught. I learnt Ruby on my own with no help. The reason why is, because I can learn stuff very good on my own. I'm also very interested in languages (be it real or computer languages). I even made my own language called <a href="http://jeytas.ddns.net/jeiios">Jeiios</a>.</p>

<p>Jeidos is the name of this little <em>operating system</em>. You can download it (.exe files will be available later) and start it. Just follow the instruction that says <code>[...] Start by typing in 'help'</code> and you will be able to get an interactive help menu.
There are already quite a few features, including a little <em>user management</em> that you can try out for yourself.</p>
