My first \"Operating System\" was [JeytasOS](http://jeytas.github.io/JeytasOS/) and I discontinued working on it after a while.\r\nThis was my first big project after over half a year. This will also be a project you'll be able to find on my [JeytasGame](http://jeytasgame.de.vc) website, after it moved to my new [jeytas.ddns.net](http://jeytas.ddns.net) server.\r\n\r\n**About me**\r\n\r\nIf you don't know me that well, I can tell you a little about myself. I am a German (part Swedish) programmer who's currently living in a small town in the region of Westphalia.\r\nI've always been interested in electronics, computers and languages. And on one day of 2008, I decided to make my own website called [Tierworld](http://tierworld.repage6.de/). That was my first website ever. Then I continued making websites and taught myself HTML5 and Javascript. Afterwards I wanted to start making *real* programmes. I went to an [Ubuntu Forum](http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/) and posted this post: [Programming-Post](http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/programmieren-6/). Then I searched around the Internet a bit to find good beginner tutorials and I found a website that promoted KidsRuby: [KidsRuby Promotion](http://rorbecker.com/spelskola/komigang.html). I looked at it and thought: \"I could use that... but that would be too easy\". So I used the \"hard\" way and installed everything by myself. But the post promoted something else. It was a gem called Gosu. They said you can make games with it, so I tried installing it. After it didn't work, I gave up and used the normal version of Ruby. I made my first game (a text adventure), called [The Legend of Dimando](http://thelegendofdimando.jimdo.com/). I worked on it almost every day, but then I slowly stopped doing anything with it and it eventually stopped.\r\nThen, in 2014, I came back to Gosu. I got in contact with its developer **Julian Raschke**. He helped me programme, and so my first game was being made. After a while and a lot of programmes, I decided to take a break from programming. But that break was not to last long, because we had to do work experience in school. I wanted to do something I really like and I can do. \r\nI *worked* in the IKT (Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie / Information and communications techonolgy) of the Wittekindshof in [Bad Oeynhausen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Oeynhausen). I worked there for three weeks and got a lot of new knowledge about IT itself. I've visited every part of the IKT, including the server room. This let to the idea of making my own server with my Raspberry Pi (and so I did [Server](http://jeytas.ddns.net)). I also learnt the programming language used there, called FOP (at least its basics). But besides that, my programming skills are all self-taught. I learnt Ruby on my own with no help. The reason why is, because I can learn stuff very good on my own. I'm also very interested in languages (be it real or computer languages). I even made my own language called [Jeiios](http://jeytas.ddns.net/jeiios).\r\n\r\n## Jeidos itself\r\nJeidos is the name of this little *operating system*. You can download it (.exe files will be available later) and start it. Just follow the instruction that says `[...] Start by typing in 'help'` and you will be able to get an interactive help menu.\r\nThere are already quite a few features, including a little *user management* that you can try out for yourself.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
