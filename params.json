{"name":"Jeidos","tagline":"","body":"# Jeidos\r\n\r\n## About the programme and me\r\n\r\nI've started something like this several times, but this time I hope I am going to make it bigger and better.\r\nThis little 'DOS' is suppose to be a little clone of MS-Dos. My first \"Operating System\" was [JeytasOS](http://jeytas.github.io/JeytasOS/) and I discontinued working on it after a while.\r\nAfter making a few programmes that use graphics, I stopped programming for a while and started learning real languages. \r\nThen my school work experience began and I did it in an IT-Department of a 'company' in my town. Directly in the first week I started programming again.\r\nI was bored sometimes (I didn't have tasks all the time), so I went to [Koding](http://koding.com) with my Laptop whilst on work and there I started programming the programme you are looking at right now.\r\nThis was my first big project after over half a year. This will also be a project you'll be able to find on my [JeytasGame](http://jeytasgame.de.vc) website, after it moved to my new [jeytas.ddns.net](http://jeytas.ddns.net) server.\r\n\r\n## Jeidos itself\r\nJeidos is the name of this little *operating system*. You can download it (.exe files will be available later) and start it. Just follow the instruction that says `[...] Start by typing in 'help'` and you will be able to get an interactive help menu.\r\nThere are already quite a few features, including a little *user management* that you can try out for yourself.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
