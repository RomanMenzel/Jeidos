## About the programme and me

I've started something like this several times, but this time I hope I am going to make it bigger and better.
This little 'DOS' is suppose to be a little clone of MS-Dos. My first "Operating System" was [JeytasOS](http://jeytas.github.io/JeytasOS/) and I discontinued working on it after a while.
After making a few programmes that use graphics, I stopped programming for a while and started learning real languages. 
Then my school work experience began and I did it in an IT-Department of a 'company' in my town. Directly in the first week I started programming again.
I was bored sometimes (I didn't have tasks all the time), so I went to [Koding](http://koding.com) with my Laptop whilst on work and there I started programming the programme you are looking at right now.
This was my first big project after over half a year. This will also be a project you'll be able to find on my [JeytasGame](http://jeytasgame.de.vc) website, after it moved to my new [jeytas.ddns.net](http://jeytas.ddns.net) server.
If you don't know me that well, I can tell you a little about myself. I am German (part Swedish) programmer who's currently living in a small town in the region of Westphalia. I *worked* in the IKT (Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie / Information and communication techonolgy) of the Wittekindshof

## Jeidos itself
Jeidos is the name of this little *operating system*. You can download it (.exe files will be available later) and start it. Just follow the instruction that says `[...] Start by typing in 'help'` and you will be able to get an interactive help menu.
There are already quite a few features, including a little *user management* that you can try out for yourself.
